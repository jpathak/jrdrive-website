                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What cloud services does JRDrive support?</h4>
                    <p>JRDrive supports a wide variety of cloud storage providers including:</p>

                        <li>And many more via rclone compatibility</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How many remotes can I add?</h4>
                    <p>Free users can add up to 2 cloud storage remotes. Premium users can add unlimited remotes to manage all their cloud storage in one place.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Does JRDrive store my files?</h4>
                    <p>No. JRDrive connects directly to your cloud storage providers. Your files remain on your cloud services - JRDrive simply provides a unified interface to access and manage them. Downloaded files are cached temporarily on your device for playback and viewing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is my data secure?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. JRDrive stores your cloud service credentials securely in the iOS Keychain. All communication with cloud providers uses encrypted connections. Your credentials and files never pass through our servers.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What is an encrypted remote?</h4>
                    <p>Encrypted remotes allow you to store files on any cloud provider with client-side encryption. Only you have the encryption password - your cloud provider cannot read your encrypted files. This feature is available with JRDrive Premium.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Can I stream videos from my cloud storage?</h4>
                    <p>Yes! JRDrive includes a built-in video player that can stream videos directly from your cloud storage without needing to download the entire file first.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What are thumbnail previews?</h4>
                    <p>JRDrive Premium can generate thumbnail previews for images and videos stored in your cloud storage, making it easier to browse and find your files visually.</p>
