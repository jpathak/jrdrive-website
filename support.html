                <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What remote storage does JRDrive support?</h4>
                    <p>JRDrive supports 40+ cloud storage providers and remote server types, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Amazon S3, Backblaze B2</li>
                        <li>WebDAV servers (Nextcloud, ownCloud, etc.)</li>
                        <li>SFTP servers (SSH File Transfer Protocol)</li>
                        <li>FTP servers</li>
                        <li>SMB/CIFS (Windows file shares, NAS devices)</li>
                        <li>Encrypted remotes (client-side encryption for any of the above)</li>
                        <li>And many more - powered by rclone</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How many remotes can I add?</h4>
                    <p>Free users can add up to 2 remotes. Premium users can add unlimited remotes to manage all their storage in one place.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Does JRDrive store my files?</h4>
                    <p>No. JRDrive connects directly to your cloud storage providers. Your files remain on your cloud services - JRDrive simply provides a unified interface to access and manage them. Downloaded files are cached temporarily on your device for playback and viewing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is my data secure?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. On iOS, JRDrive stores your cloud service credentials securely in the iOS Keychain. On Android, credentials are encrypted using EncryptedSharedPreferences backed by the Android Keystore. All communication with cloud providers uses encrypted connections. Your credentials and files never pass through our servers.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What is an encrypted remote?</h4>
                    <p>Encrypted remotes allow you to store files on any cloud provider with client-side encryption. Only you have the encryption password - your cloud provider cannot read your encrypted files. This feature is available with JRDrive Premium.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Can I stream videos and music from my cloud storage?</h4>
                    <p>Yes! JRDrive includes a built-in media player that can stream videos and audio directly from your cloud storage without needing to download the entire file first.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What are thumbnail previews?</h4>
                    <p>JRDrive Premium can generate thumbnail previews for images and videos stored in your cloud storage, making it easier to browse and find your files visually.</p>
